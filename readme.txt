2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
- I finished the assignment in 5 hours. Bonus feature is additional 2 hours. 


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
- W3school: https://www.w3schools.com/
- Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/
- Angular doc: https://angular.io/docs



4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
- No. I did it myself.


5. Did you add a bonus feature to your submission? If so, what is it and how should we see it?
- Yes. I did the public webserver deploy. 
- The url for public server: https://spotify-management-app.herokuapp.com/   (~similar to the localhost:8888). 
- We don't need to start webserver, but only start server on the client side. In other words, we only 
need to cd to client, "npm install" and start the "ng serve" command. The npm start on the webserver does not need now. 


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
- Check the webserver (already deployed) if it can run fine on the other machine. (I am not sure if the set up at other place would cause it to corrupt or not)
- Please contact me if you can not start the project (because I already change the domain different from local host).
This is my first time try to deploy so I am not really confident in my approach. 
- Install node-module before starting the project
